The Gumroad OAuth API is based around REST. We return JSON for every request, including
              errors.

To start using the API, you'll need to
                register your OAuth application.
                Note: The
                Verify License API endpoint
                does not require an OAuth application.

After creating an application, you'll be given a unique application id and application secret.

## Authentication

On the application page, click
              Generate access token
              to get the token you will use with the API.

## Scopes

We've provided six scopes that you may request when the user authorizes your application.

## Resources

Create an OAuth application
                - A getting started guide for creating an application with our API.

omniauth-gumroad
                - (Ruby) an OmniAuth strategy for Gumroad OAuth.

## API Errors

Gumroad uses HTTP status codes to indicate the status of a request. Here's a run down on likely response codes.

200 OK
        everything worked as expected.
        
400 Bad Request
        you probably missed a required parameter.
        
401 Unauthorized
        you did not provide a valid access token.
        
402 Request Failed
        the parameters were valid but request failed.
        
404 Not Found
        the requested item doesn't exist.
        
500, 502, 503, 504 Server Error
        something else went wrong on our end.

To help you further, we provide a JSON object that goes more in-depth about the problem that led to the failed request. Errors responses from the api will follow the following format.

```
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "The product could not be found."
}
```



When present, the message will describe the particular problem and suggestions on what went wrong.

## API Methods

Gumroad's OAuth 2.0 API lets you see information about your products, as well as you can add, edit, and delete offer codes, variants, and custom fields. Finally, you can see a user's public information and subscribe to be notified of their sales.

## Products

## Resource subscriptions

Subscribe to a resource. Currently there are 8 supported resource names - "sale", "refund", "dispute", "dispute_won", "cancellation", "subscription_updated", "subscription_ended", and "subscription_restarted".

sale - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified of the user's sales with an HTTP POST to your post_url. The format of the POST is described on the Gumroad Ping page.

refund - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified of refunds to the user's sales with an HTTP POST to your post_url. The format of the POST is same as described on the Gumroad Ping page.

dispute - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified of the disputes raised against user's sales with an HTTP POST to your post_url. The format of the POST is described on the Gumroad Ping page.

dispute_won - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified of the sale disputes won by the user with an HTTP POST to your post_url. The format of the POST is described on the Gumroad Ping page.

cancellation - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified of cancellations of the user's subscribers with an HTTP POST to your post_url.

subscription_updated - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified when subscriptions to the user's products have been upgraded or downgraded with an HTTP POST to your post_url. A subscription is "upgraded" when the subscriber switches to an equally or more expensive tier and/or subscription duration. It is "downgraded" when the subscriber switches to a less expensive tier and/or subscription duration. In the case of a downgrade, this change will take effect at the end of the current billing period. (Note: This currently applies only to tiered membership products, not to all subscription products.)

subscription_ended - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified when subscriptions to the user's products have ended with an HTTP POST to your post_url. These events include termination of a subscription due to: failed payment(s); cancellation; or a subscription of fixed duration ending. Notifications are sent at the time the subscription has officially ended, not, for example, at the time cancellation is requested.

subscription_restarted - When subscribed to this resource, you will be notified when subscriptions to the user's products have been restarted with an HTTP POST to your post_url. A subscription is "restarted" when the subscriber restarts their subscription after previously terminating it.

In each POST request, Gumroad sends these parameters:
subscription_id: id of the subscription
product_id: id of the product
product_name: name of the product
user_id: user id of the subscriber
user_email: email address of the subscriber
purchase_ids: array of charge ids belonging to this subscription

recurrence: subscription duration - monthly/quarterly/biannually/yearly/every_two_years
free_trial_ends_at: timestamp when free trial ends, if free trial is enabled for the membership
custom_fields: custom fields from the original purchase
license_key: license key from the original purchase

For "cancellation" resource:
cancelled: true if subscription has been cancelled, otherwise false
cancelled_at: timestamp at which subscription will be cancelled
cancelled_by_admin: true if subscription was been cancelled by admin, otherwise not present
cancelled_by_buyer: true if subscription was been cancelled by buyer, otherwise not present
cancelled_by_seller: true if subscription was been cancelled by seller, otherwise not present
cancelled_due_to_payment_failures: true if subscription was been cancelled automatically because of payment failure, otherwise not present

For "subscription_updated" resource:
type: "upgrade" or "downgrade"
effective_as_of: timestamp at which the change went or will go into effect
old_plan: tier, subscription duration, price, and quantity of the subscription before the change
new_plan: tier, subscription duration, price, and quantity of the subscription after the change

```
{
  ...
  type: "upgrade",
  effective_as_of: "2021-02-23T16:31:44Z",
